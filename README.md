# sqlalchemy-challenge

This is my sqlalchemy-challenge it consists of the hawaii.sqlite file (CSVs not used)required to conduct the climate analysis, data exploration of the climate database and also, to design/create the Climate App, 
climate_final jupyter file which consists of the code which analysis and explores the climate database and finally, the app_final python file which consists of the code which designs and creates the Climate app.


Note; I did receive assistance from a tutor and a learning assistant when it came to the <start> and <start>/<end> date range portion of designing/creating my Climate app
